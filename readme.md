# Quartermaster
### A recipe-management tool for PalmOS 3.0

I've frequently wanted an easy way to find all the recipes I could make with the food I already have at home, or wondered what dishes use an ingredient. Quartermaster is my solution to that problem: a versatile, searchable, and portable recipe database.

Inspired by Sudo-nano's [application by the same name.](https://github.com/sudo-nano/quartermaster).

Currently in early development!

Made using the Codewarriors IDE


## Issues

 - Maybe add add ingredient panel for adding ingredients without creating a recipe?
 	- also manual removal of manually-added recipes
 	- Recipe section of yaml file format
 - Add scrollbar to edit interface?
 - General interface polish
